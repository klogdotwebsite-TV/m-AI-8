My n8n workflows and attemps to reprogram things in C++.

And n8n pinned to version 1.89.2 - because it's quite recent and I know an easy way to setup the Javascript enviroment.

You can also just:

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n.git

git checkout tags/n8n@1.89.2
```

To achieve the same thing, especially if you plan on making changes and pushing them upstream - and want to appear as a contributor. Well you should make a Github account fork the repo and you will need to use the ssh link ( git@github.com:your-account/n8n.git ) for that but you should git clone it independately.
