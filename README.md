My n8n workflows and attemps to reprogram things in C++.

And n8n pinned to version 1.89.2 you can also just:

```
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n.git

git checkout tags/n8n@1.89.2
```

To achieve the same thing, especially if you plan on making changes and pushing them upstream - and want to appear as a contributor.
